Sam,

FYI.  minor corrections to the heading line for the UCB device
address.

Ken, attached is the modified DISKMAP with the code I mentioned.
I tested this under z/OS 1.6 which we have up on our test LPAR
and it worked fine.  Maybe Sam can update the CBTMODs tape.  Good
luck.

Regards,
Al Buschmann
